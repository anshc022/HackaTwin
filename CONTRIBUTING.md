## 🚀 Getting Started (Your Hero's Journey)

### 📋 Prerequisites (Your Starting Equipment)

```bash
# Make sure you have these installed:
- Git (for version control magic)
- Node.js 18+ (the JavaScript runtime)
- Python 3.12+ (the snake charmer)
- A code editor (VS Code recommended for best experience)
- Coffee ☕ (mandatory for late-night coding sessions)
- Sense of humor 😄 (essential for surviving code reviews)
```

### 🎯 Step-by-Step Adventure Guide

#### 1. 🍴 Fork the Repository (Claim Your Territory)
```bash
# Click that fork button like it owes you money!
# https://github.com/anshc022/HackaTwin/fork
```

#### 2. 🏠 Clone Your Fork (Bring It Home)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/HackaTwin.git
cd HackaTwin

# Celebrate! You now have your own copy 🎉
```

#### 3. 🌿 Create a Branch (Your Personal Workspace)
```bash
# Follow our naming convention:
git checkout -b feature/awesome-new-feature     # For new features
git checkout -b bugfix/fix-that-annoying-thing  # For bug fixes
git checkout -b docs/improve-readme             # For documentation
git checkout -b refactor/make-code-prettier     # For refactoring
```

#### 4. 🏗️ Set Up Development Environment (Prepare for Battle)

**Backend Setup:**
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
python init_db.py  # Initialize the database
```

**Frontend Setup:**
```bash
cd my-app
npm install
# OR if you prefer yarn (we don't judge)
yarn install
```

#### 5. 🔥 Start the Development Servers (Awaken the Beast)
```bash
# Backend (Terminal 1)
cd backend
python main.py

# Frontend (Terminal 2)
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## 🎨 Development Guidelines (The Sacred Rules)

### 📝 Code Style (Make It Pretty)

#### Python/Backend Rules:
```python
# Good: Clear, descriptive names
def get_all_volunteers_with_their_coffee_preferences():
    """
    Fetches all volunteers and their caffeine dependencies.
    Returns: Dict of volunteers with their coffee orders
    """
    pass

# Bad: Cryptic abbreviations
def get_vol_cof():  # What does this even do?
    pass

# Always use type hints (your future self will thank you)
def send_email(recipient: str, subject: str, body: str) -> bool:
    """Send an email and pray to the SMTP gods."""
    return True
```

#### TypeScript/Frontend Rules:
```typescript
// Good: Descriptive interfaces
interface VolunteerData {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  coffeePreference: 'latte' | 'espresso' | 'cold brew' | 'whatever is free';
}

// Good: Functional components with clear props
const VolunteerCard: React.FC<{ volunteer: VolunteerData }> = ({ volunteer }) => {
  return (
    <div className="volunteer-card">
      <h3>{volunteer.name}</h3>
      <p>Preferred caffeine delivery method: {volunteer.coffeePreference}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

// Bad: Any types (the dark side)
const badFunction = (data: any) => {
  // This is a path to the dark side
  return data.something.maybe.exists;
};
```

### 🧪 Testing (Prove Your Code Works)

```bash
# Backend Tests
cd backend
python -m pytest tests/

# Frontend Tests
cd my-app
npm test

# Integration Tests (the real deal)
npm run test:integration
```

#### Writing Good Tests:
```python
# Good: Descriptive test names
def test_volunteer_can_be_assigned_multiple_coffee_tasks():
    """Test that a volunteer can handle multiple coffee-related assignments."""
    volunteer = create_test_volunteer()
    coffee_task = create_coffee_task()
    another_coffee_task = create_another_coffee_task()
    
    volunteer.assign_task(coffee_task)
    volunteer.assign_task(another_coffee_task)
    
    assert len(volunteer.tasks) == 2
    assert all('coffee' in task.description.lower() for task in volunteer.tasks)

# Bad: Unclear test purpose
def test_stuff():
    # What are we testing here?
    thing = Thing()
    thing.do_something()
    assert True  # This doesn't test anything useful
```

### 📏 Commit Message Convention (Tell a Story)

We follow the "Conventional Commits" style with a HackaTwin twist:

```bash
# Format: type(scope): description [emoji]

# Examples:
feat(dashboard): add coffee consumption tracking ☕
fix(api): resolve email sending timeout issues 📧
docs(readme): add funny memes and better examples 😄
style(components): improve button hover animations ✨
refactor(database): optimize volunteer query performance 🚀
test(outreach): add comprehensive email service tests 🧪
chore(deps): update dependencies to latest versions 📦

# For breaking changes:
feat(api)!: redesign volunteer endpoints 💥
BREAKING CHANGE: volunteer endpoints now require authentication
```
