## Technical Report

### Project Overview
HackaTwin is an intelligent hackathon management platform that automates administrative tasks through AI-powered workflows, enabling organizers to focus on creating exceptional participant experiences.

### Architecture & Technology Stack

**Backend (FastAPI + SQLAlchemy)**
- **Core Framework**: FastAPI with Python 3.12, providing async API endpoints
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy ORM with SQLite, featuring 11 comprehensive data models
- **API Design**: RESTful architecture with 25+ endpoints including comprehensive data aggregation
- **AI Integration**: Local LLM integration for content generation and smart task assignment
- **Data Management**: Automated migration from JSON logs to structured database

**Frontend (Next.js + React)**
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript for type-safe development
- **UI/UX**: Tailwind CSS with responsive design and dark mode support
- **Components**: Modular dashboard architecture with 8 specialized management cards
- **State Management**: React hooks with real-time API integration
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering with component-based architecture

### Key Technical Innovations

**1. Intelligent Data Aggregation**
- Unified API endpoints combining database and log file data
- Real-time statistics generation with performance metrics
- Comprehensive data views showing 20+ data points across all modules

**2. AI-Powered Automation**
